		<h5 title="to the best place on earth"> Here we are!</h5>
		<p><tt>This is the most famous</tt> sight on <sup>Capri, where visitors from </sup>around the world<sub> form long queues to get a peek </sub>inside for just a few magical moments: we're talking about the Blue Grotto, of course. This natural cavern is 25 meters wide and <b>60 meters</b> long, with a tiny entrance less than a meter high. <br>To enter, visitors lay back in wooden rowboats and glide through the low cave mouth. Once inside, the boats bob in the dark, suspended on the surface of water so blue that it seems dream-like.</br>

Floating in the <i>Grotta Azzurra</i> is an experience that should be on any traveller's bucket list. </p>
	<p style="letter-spacing:7em;" color="#FF4500;">The glowing effect of the water inside the Blue Grotto is due to the sunlight which enters through a second, underwater cave mouth beneath that on the surface. For this reason, the most intense color comes with the most intense sunlight during the midday hours of noon to <u>2:00 p.m..</u> The difference between the first morning light and the late afternoon light is negligible, though there is often a longer line in the afternoon. It is best to avoid visiting the grotto on overcast days, when there internal glow is much less dramatic. </p>
